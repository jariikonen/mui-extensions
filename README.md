## Installation

```

## Components

### ModalAutocomplete

```
import { ModalAutocomplete } from '@jariikonen/mui-extensions'
```

A mobile friendly autocomplete component extending MUI Material UI's [Autocomplete](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-autocomplete/).

Functions like a regular MUI Material Autocomplete, except opens a separate user interface in a responsive modal component centered on the screen, when the size of the screen is below the `sm` [breakpoint](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/breakpoints/). Makes using the component easier on a mobile device.
